Ten thousand races and all spirits are just nourished by these rulers. These masters harvest the Taoists, harvest the spirituality of each world, and destroy one by one. The Taoists in the past were unwilling to be reaped and resisted constantly, but failed every time. Until… the protagonist Ye Yu appeared, he peeled away one time and one secret. As he unfolded an epic picture scroll, in this magnificent world, he continued to grow, experience love and friendship, cleanse the dusted Taoist heart, and finally confront the master who harvests all races.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

At the top of each episode, guests let the roll of the dice decide who will take on the role of Tavern Keeper (a sort of quasi-host?) and thus steer the show with absolutely no preparation. In addition to discussing the campaign and characters, party games and chaos will be sprinkled in. Fan questions will also be pulled from the Tower of Inquiry, a \"Chenga\" tower that yields serious consequences when it all comes crashing down.</p><p><b>4-Sided Dive</b> airs the first Tuesday of every month.</p>",

She falls in love at first sight with Immortal Lord Mo Chenyuan and forces him back to the demon realm to marry her. Mo Chenyuan has always had a crush on Feng Ruoyao. Since he has been seriously injured by his half-brother in secret, he turns Feng Ruoyao's trick to his own use and allows himself to be captured by her in order to recuperate in the demon realm. The two seem to be quarrelsome foes, but in fact, their love is two-way. No matter what obstacles they encounter, they always treat each other with sincerity. Eventually, they manage to eliminate the gap between the immortal and the demon and get together...</p>",

It was a crash course that taught him two things: anyone can understand these issues, and we all have an obligation to try. That's why he started Pod Save the World—a weekly podcast that breaks down international news and foreign policy developments, but doesn't feel like homework. Each week, he and former deputy national security advisor and co-host Ben Rhodes walk you through the latest developments with a variety of experts and take you behind the scenes of big decisions with the people who were there. Count on hearing stories from the White House Situation Room, funny anecdotes, and maybe a few F bombs along the way.</p>",

The Galgo Group, the family business that has seen three generations grow, is going through its worst moment and everyone around it is looking to take advantage. The crisis in the sector, the imminent arrival of the sugar law and the lack of leadership of Emilio, president of Galgo since his father died, are shaking the company's future. So Gonzalo Díaz, after years of working alongside Emilio, sets out to implement his own plans for the company. The one neither of them counted on was Carmina, Gonzalo's wife and also heir to the group as Emilio's sister. In a turn of events, Carmina makes a unilateral decision and unleashes a family and business earthquake that will also affect her children Blanca, Guzmán, Jimena and Julián. Interests and power struggles separate them and Carmina will have to choose between saving the company or saving her family.</p>",

At the heart of the story is Sarah Fenn, Sanctuary's resident witch, on whom the town relies to solve their problems when conventional remedies have failed. When local teen rugby star, Dan Whithall, dies tragically in an apparent accident, his death exposes a terrifying undercurrent of suspicion and fear towards Sarah and her teenage daughter, Harper. Mother of the dead boy, Abigail, once Sarah's closest friend, is wracked with grief, and to avenge her son's death, launches a modern-day witch-hunt to get \"justice\", no matter what the cost.</p>",

Huang Yingzi went to Beijing for school and Jiang Yi left for the States. \"Who do you like at the age of seventeen\" has become a mystery lingering in the hearts of the seven people. As newcomers in the workplace, they were bruised and battered from the skirmishes between their ideals and reality. Their once pure emotions are like shining stars in the night sky. Huang Yingzi wants to reunite the group only to realize that there a question remains. Meanwhile, Jiang Yi and the others have already been presented their answer.</p>",

Above all, <i>Chicken Shop Date</i> proves that whoever said romance is dead has never been on a date to Chicken Cottage.</p>",

Her night street is gripped by a completely new, terrifying phenomenon - young sexual rapists with sadistic tendencies. Elite criminal Jiří Markovič sets out on the trail of these very criminals.</p><p>The miniseries not only follows the process of the investigation and capture of Ladislav Hojer, but above all offers an insight into the specific relationship between Hojer and Markovic. In each volume, he also provides insight into other closed cases that shaped Markovič's career as an elite investigator and illustrate the development of his method.</p>",

Huang Yingzi went to Beijing for school and Jiang Yi left for the States. \"Who do you like at the age of seventeen\" has become a mystery lingering in the hearts of the seven people. As newcomers in the workplace, they were bruised and battered from the skirmishes between their ideals and reality. Their once pure emotions are like shining stars in the night sky. Huang Yingzi wants to reunite the group only to realize that there a question remains. Meanwhile, Jiang Yi and the others have already been presented their answer.</p>",

Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",

                "summary": "<p><b>AMA Supercross</b> is a motorcycle racing sport involving off-road motorcycles on an artificially-made dirt track consisting of steep jumps and obstacles. Professional supercross contest races are held almost exclusively within professional baseball and football stadiums, although one contest is held at a major motorsport venue (Daytona International Speedway) in the island that separates pit lane from the circuit. Supercross is a very technical sport. Supercross was derived of Motocross. While Motocross and Supercross are similar in many respects, there are significant differences as well. For example, the Supercross races are heavily advertised and televised motorsports events held within major cities.</p><p>The sport Supercross is tailored to the TV spectator, as result of widespread television coverage, as its target market. The term \"Supercross\" was coined as the event name for the first organized motocross race that was successfully held inside a stadium in the United States. In 1972, racing promoter Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, president of the AMA at the time, staged what they called the \"Super Bowl of Motocross\" inside the Los Angeles Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. This event was won by Marty Tripes at the age of 16. That initial contest featured many of the top Motocross riders of the time. It was such a commercial success that it spawned many imitators, and the term \"Supercross\" was coined to identify the similar to Motocross stadium cycling events. Modern Supercross races are sanctioned and governed by motorcycle associations, the main series being either the American Motorcyclist Association which is the oldest and most prestigious cycle racing organization (in America), or the Monster Energy series of Supercross Championship events that are in part the work of Clear Channel, who in 2004 contributed expertise in filming on-track gate event competition for Supercross.</p>",

She falls in love at first sight with Immortal Lord Mo Chenyuan and forces him back to the demon realm to marry her. Mo Chenyuan has always had a crush on Feng Ruoyao.

The two seem to be quarrelsome foes, but in fact, their love is two-way. No matter what obstacles they encounter, they always treat each other with sincerity. Eventually, they manage to eliminate the gap between the immortal and the demon and get together...</p>",

Huang Yingzi went to Beijing for school and Jiang Yi left for the States. \"Who do you like at the age of seventeen\" has become a mystery lingering in the hearts of the seven people. As newcomers in the workplace, they were bruised and battered from the skirmishes between their ideals and reality. Their once pure emotions are like shining stars in the night sky. Huang Yingzi wants to reunite the group only to realize that there a question remains. Meanwhile, Jiang Yi and the others have already been presented their answer.</p>",

Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",

Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",
