When Muyun first woke up, he was deliberately bothered by the student Miaoxianyu. Muyun easily completed the Miaoxianyu trap, and he gave more and more alchemy skills by analogy, so the Alchemy masters outside the door could not ask for appreciation. Endless back home, Mu Yun learns that he is about to marry Nona Qin Qin Mengyao. Qin Mengyao was cold and toxic, but could not live until he was 20 years old. The marriage was only for the sake of pastoralists and family of Qin. However, under Mu Linchen's enticement, Mu Yun approves the family's issue on the condition of alchemy.</p><p><br /> </p>",

When Man Zhu experienced the disaster, she suffered a counterattack. Sha Hua saved Man Zhu and thus suffered a natural disaster. Man Zhu ignored the pain of her body and went to save Sha Hua. Sha Hua could not see her sister suffering and decided to sacrifice herself. The god was moved by the emotions of the two sisters and decided to give them a chance to meet when the red magic lily bloomed on the other side. But they agreed to \"not recognize each other\" between meetings. Man Zhu waited again and again, and finally saw Sha Hua, who had lost her memory in the world, but at this time, Sha Hua was already a mortal, named Qian Xia, who was the chief constable of the pure evil department. After the appearance of Man Zhu, there was a legend in the bustling Guangling City. There was a place in the city called the Magic Mirror Pavilion. Its owner was a mysterious woman in red. It is said that as long as you have a wish to realize it, she can help you complete it. The price of realizing the wish is to exchange it with her with your \"one thought\", and Qian Xia was also involved in investigating murders, and embarked on a case investigation journey with the beautiful owner Man Zhu.</p>",

All races and spirits have different races and different beliefs, but the same is the extravagant hope for Taoism. Any living beings are dusted with Dao heart, they are not willing to do this, they become powerful and even live forever by enlightening Dao through practice. The Avenue of Heaven and Earth is like luck, where the able live. The road to the great road is the road to struggle for the road, which has caused the struggle of all races and souls. An era can only support a few people to gain the Tao. Those who have attained the Tao think that standing on the top of the world, they can be free in the future. But I found that even Dao. It's also hard to escape bad luck. There is a ruler above them, harvesting one era after another, and the cultivators of the world want to maintain their ambitions. Ten thousand races and all spirits are just nourished by these rulers. These masters harvest the Taoists, harvest the spirituality of each world, and destroy one by one. The Taoists in the past were unwilling to be reaped and resisted constantly, but failed every time. Until… the protagonist Ye Yu appeared, he peeled away one time and one secret. As he unfolded an epic picture scroll, in this magnificent world, he continued to grow, experience love and friendship, cleanse the dusted Taoist heart, and finally confront the master who harvests all races.</p>",

When Man Zhu experienced the disaster, she suffered a counterattack. Sha Hua saved Man Zhu and thus suffered a natural disaster. Man Zhu ignored the pain of her body and went to save Sha Hua. Sha Hua could not see her sister suffering and decided to sacrifice herself. The god was moved by the emotions of the two sisters and decided to give them a chance to meet when the red magic lily bloomed on the other side. But they agreed to \"not recognize each other\" between meetings. Man Zhu waited again and again, and finally saw Sha Hua, who had lost her memory in the world, but at this time, Sha Hua was already a mortal, named Qian Xia, who was the chief constable of the pure evil department. After the appearance of Man Zhu, there was a legend in the bustling Guangling City. There was a place in the city called the Magic Mirror Pavilion. Its owner was a mysterious woman in red. It is said that as long as you have a wish to realize it, she can help you complete it. The price of realizing the wish is to exchange it with her with your \"one thought\", and Qian Xia was also involved in investigating murders, and embarked on a case investigation journey with the beautiful owner Man Zhu.</p>",

When Man Zhu experienced the disaster, she suffered a counterattack. Sha Hua saved Man Zhu and thus suffered a natural disaster. Man Zhu ignored the pain of her body and went to save Sha Hua. Sha Hua could not see her sister suffering and decided to sacrifice herself. The god was moved by the emotions of the two sisters and decided to give them a chance to meet when the red magic lily bloomed on the other side. But they agreed to \"not recognize each other\" between meetings. Man Zhu waited again and again, and finally saw Sha Hua, who had lost her memory in the world, but at this time, Sha Hua was already a mortal, named Qian Xia, who was the chief constable of the pure evil department. After the appearance of Man Zhu, there was a legend in the bustling Guangling City. There was a place in the city called the Magic Mirror Pavilion. Its owner was a mysterious woman in red. It is said that as long as you have a wish to realize it, she can help you complete it. The price of realizing the wish is to exchange it with her with your \"one thought\", and Qian Xia was also involved in investigating murders, and embarked on a case investigation journey with the beautiful owner Man Zhu.</p>",

Katya does not want her daughter to be sent to an orphanage after her death, and asks Lech to take hold of her head so that he becomes the guardian of an eight-year-old girl. Lech has already lost many close people in his life, so he does everything to help his sister: he gathers old connections and gets a job at the police station. The area turns out to be difficult. The criminals that Lech must catch are fairy—tale characters: Serpent Gorynych, Baba Yaga and other evil spirits. And if the former sniper has no problems catching villains, then trying to become a good guardian becomes a real test for Lehi.</p>",

Sha Hua could not see her sister suffering and decided to sacrifice herself. The god was moved by the emotions of the two sisters and decided to give them a chance to meet when the red magic lily bloomed on the other side. But they agreed to \"not recognize each other\" between meetings. Man Zhu waited again and again, and finally saw Sha Hua, who had lost her memory in the world, but at this time, Sha Hua was already a mortal, named Qian Xia, who was the chief constable of the pure evil department. After the appearance of Man Zhu, there was a legend in the bustling Guangling City. There was a place in the city called the Magic Mirror Pavilion. Its owner was a mysterious woman in red. It is said that as long as you have a wish to realize it, she can help you complete it. The price of realizing the wish is to exchange it with her with your \"one thought\", and Qian Xia was also involved in investigating murders, and embarked on a case investigation journey with the beautiful owner Man Zhu.</p>",

Any living beings are dusted with Dao heart, they are not willing to do this, they become powerful and even live forever by enlightening Dao through practice. The Avenue of Heaven and Earth is like luck, where the able live. The road to the great road is the road to struggle for the road, which has caused the struggle of all races and souls. An era can only support a few people to gain the Tao. Those who have attained the Tao think that standing on the top of the world, they can be free in the future. But I found that even Dao. It's also hard to escape bad luck. There is a ruler above them, harvesting one era after another, and the cultivators of the world want to maintain their ambitions. Ten thousand races and all spirits are just nourished by these rulers. These masters harvest the Taoists, harvest the spirituality of each world, and destroy one by one. The Taoists in the past were unwilling to be reaped and resisted constantly, but failed every time. Until… the protagonist Ye Yu appeared, he peeled away one time and one secret. As he unfolded an epic picture scroll, in this magnificent world, he continued to grow, experience love and friendship, cleanse the dusted Taoist heart, and finally confront the master who harvests all races.</p>",

Hidden in plain sight throughout the Southwest and Mexico, a splinter group of Mormon fundamentalist cult members perpetrate a deadly wave of violence and abuse for decades in the name of their fanatical prophet Ervil LeBaron, dubbed the Mormon Manson. Survivors, relatives of killers and law enforcement now come forward to paint an emotional and grisly picture of a brutal madman ordering cold-blooded executions. Despite running from the FBI for most of their young lives there is triumph, healing, and sisterhood for the brave few who escape and begin anew.</p>",

When Muyun first woke up, he was deliberately bothered by the student Miaoxianyu. Muyun easily completed the Miaoxianyu trap, and he gave more and more alchemy skills by analogy, so the Alchemy masters outside the door could not ask for appreciation.

The marriage was only for the sake of pastoralists and family of Qin. However, under Mu Linchen's enticement, Mu Yun approves the family's issue on the condition of alchemy.</p><p><br /> </p>",

To ensure that his skills are passed down to future generations, finish the Chinese brush. A normal college student named Luo Zhongxia accidently acquired Li Bai's Qinglian posthumous Chinese brush two thousand years later, and ever then, he has held the superpowers provided by the brush spirit. The happy times did not endure, however, as other forces were drawn to the potent influence of Qinglian's works, which frequently put Luo Zhongxia in danger. Luo Zhongxia dedicated himself to finding a way to retract his essay in order to prevent conflicts, but he kept running across roadblocks. He instead developed a strong bond with the \"Seven Lords in charge of the city\".</p>",

                "summary": "<p><b>AMA Supercross</b> is a motorcycle racing sport involving off-road motorcycles on an artificially-made dirt track consisting of steep jumps and obstacles. Professional supercross contest races are held almost exclusively within professional baseball and football stadiums, although one contest is held at a major motorsport venue (Daytona International Speedway) in the island that separates pit lane from the circuit. Supercross is a very technical sport. Supercross was derived of Motocross. While Motocross and Supercross are similar in many respects, there are significant differences as well. For example, the Supercross races are heavily advertised and televised motorsports events held within major cities.</p><p>The sport Supercross is tailored to the TV spectator, as result of widespread television coverage, as its target market. The term \"Supercross\" was coined as the event name for the first organized motocross race that was successfully held inside a stadium in the United States. In 1972, racing promoter Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, president of the AMA at the time, staged what they called the \"Super Bowl of Motocross\" inside the Los Angeles Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. This event was won by Marty Tripes at the age of 16. That initial contest featured many of the top Motocross riders of the time. It was such a commercial success that it spawned many imitators, and the term \"Supercross\" was coined to identify the similar to Motocross stadium cycling events. Modern Supercross races are sanctioned and governed by motorcycle associations, the main series being either the American Motorcyclist Association which is the oldest and most prestigious cycle racing organization (in America), or the Monster Energy series of Supercross Championship events that are in part the work of Clear Channel, who in 2004 contributed expertise in filming on-track gate event competition for Supercross.</p>",

The rituals, costumes, and texts of carols vary not only between regions, but sometimes even within the same village. In Soviet times, the church, and thus all these holidays, were banned. Carolers and malanka players were detained for performing ritual songs. As a result, in most regions of Ukraine, the authentic tradition of celebration was interrupted for several decades. Today, it is gradually reviving or continuing in places where Soviet bans could not fully reach. Watch our documentary series to see how we have seen Christmas and Malanka in different regions of Ukraine over the years.</p>",
