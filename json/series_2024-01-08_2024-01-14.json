        "summary": "<p>Young MasterChef returns for a second series as nine of Britain's best young cooks press pause on their day jobs to put their kitchen skills to the test. Judging their every move is Michelin-trained social media sensation Poppy O'Toole, who is joined by a new judge – chef, author and YouTube food star Big Has.</p><p>Britain's culinary revolution is hotter than ever, and young enthusiasts hungry for success are paving the way with exciting street dishes, pop-ups and foodie followers on socials.</p><p>Those who are rewriting the rules and stirring up the industry now take another leap into the MasterChef kitchen. Who has what it takes to reach the endgame? The stage is set for the ultimate kitchen battle.</p><p>It's day one of the competition, as all nine of this year's rookie cooks rock up in east London ready to take on the Young MasterChef kitchen. It's all systems go as they face two demanding challenges set by judges Poppy and Big Has. The stakes are high, as the two who fail to make the grade will have their MasterChef adventure cut short.</p><p>First up, the hopefuls get a chance to size up their competition, as they are tasked with cooking their ‘number one' dish - a plate that shows off personality, has bags of flavour and leaves the judges hungry for more. They will hit the supermarket to buy their own ingredients, but there's a twist! With limited cash, the cooks will have to get creative on a budget. Choosing wisely is key, as the two who stand out from the pack with an original tasty treat will be immune from elimination in the next round, so this is no time to be raiding the ready meal aisle.</p><p>Next up, the skill factor is turned up a notch as the nine cooks are asked to deliver one of the judges' go-to dishes, the perfect plate of pasta, from scratch. Luckily, Big Has is a master with pasta and helps to inspire with a demo of his scrumptious ricotta, parmesan and black pepper ravioli drenched in a sage butter sauce. Who can take instruction and give the Italians a run for their money? Overcooked pasta or a watery sauce just won't cut it.</p><p>With two cooks already safe from elimination, the judges will pick two of the remaining seven for the chopping block. For the others, the Young MasterChef journey will be well and truly underway.</p>",

The hour-long show aired live on evenings every weekday, and was replayed in the overnight/early morning hours. It covered the major news stories of the day with a focus on politics and economics. Field correspondents provided additional reporting and occasionally served as guest anchors. During Dobbs' tenure, notable politicians and economists were often guests on the show, facing his often pointed questioning. On November 11, 2009, Dobbs announced that he would be leaving CNN effective immediately. CNN anchor John King replaced the outgoing Dobbs beginning on March 22, 2010 with his new show <i>John King, USA</i>. Dobbs was eventually hired by Fox Business Network, which re-launched <i>Lou Dobbs Tonight</i> in March 2011.</p>",

For these young, attractive, and adventurous yachties, the \"work hard, play harder\" nature of the job combined with the pressure of working in the most exclusive yachting scene in the world pushes the team close to the breaking point on <b>Below Deck Mediterranean</b>.</p>",

Qin Chen, who was inevitably dead, unexpectedly triggered the power of the mysterious ancient sword.<br /><br />Three hundred years later, in a remote part of the Tianwu mainland, a boy of the same name accidentally inherited Qin Chen's will.

It was a crash course that taught him two things: anyone can understand these issues, and we all have an obligation to try. That's why he started Pod Save the World—a weekly podcast that breaks down international news and foreign policy developments, but doesn't feel like homework. Each week, he and former deputy national security advisor and co-host Ben Rhodes walk you through the latest developments with a variety of experts and take you behind the scenes of big decisions with the people who were there. Count on hearing stories from the White House Situation Room, funny anecdotes, and maybe a few F bombs along the way.</p>",

The Avenue of Heaven and Earth is like luck, where the able live. The road to the great road is the road to struggle for the road, which has caused the struggle of all races and souls. An era can only support a few people to gain the Tao. Those who have attained the Tao think that standing on the top of the world, they can be free in the future. But I found that even Dao. It's also hard to escape bad luck. There is a ruler above them, harvesting one era after another, and the cultivators of the world want to maintain their ambitions. Ten thousand races and all spirits are just nourished by these rulers. These masters harvest the Taoists, harvest the spirituality of each world, and destroy one by one. The Taoists in the past were unwilling to be reaped and resisted constantly, but failed every time. Until… the protagonist Ye Yu appeared, he peeled away one time and one secret. As he unfolded an epic picture scroll, in this magnificent world, he continued to grow, experience love and friendship, cleanse the dusted Taoist heart, and finally confront the master who harvests all races.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

It takes place in the idyllic English town of Sanctuary, where for hundreds of years witches have lived peacefully, as valued members of society. Until now... At the heart of the story is Sarah Fenn, Sanctuary's resident witch, on whom the town relies to solve their problems when conventional remedies have failed. When local teen rugby star, Dan Whithall, dies tragically in an apparent accident, his death exposes a terrifying undercurrent of suspicion and fear towards Sarah and her teenage daughter, Harper. Mother of the dead boy, Abigail, once Sarah's closest friend, is wracked with grief, and to avenge her son's death, launches a modern-day witch-hunt to get \"justice\", no matter what the cost.</p>",

When Reacher arrives in the small town of Margrave, Georgia, he finds a community grappling with its first homicide in 20 years. The cops immediately arrest him and eyewitnesses claim to place Reacher at the scene of the crime. While he works to prove his innocence, a deep-seated conspiracy begins to emerge, one that will require Reacher's keen mind and hard-hitting fists to deal with. One thing above all is for sure: They picked the wrong guy to take the fall.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

However, the more this is the case, the less Song Zhu is interested in studying. She wants to get rid of her family's halo and spends her days thinking about how to marry herself off. Until she meets Xiao Yu (played by Zhai Zilu), the \"apprentice.\" Xiao Yu's appearance completely disrupts the life plan she has set for herself. Xiao Yu is like a calamity for Song Zhu, wherever he is, there will be disaster for Song Zhu. However, the unconvinced Song Zhu was not willing to lose at the hands of Xiao Yu. The whole academy was in a state of turmoil for a while. Because of the appearance of these two people at the Yiyang academy, they began to have a competition and confrontation with each other. The life of the academy in that era was as full of fresh and interesting stories as the campus life nowadays. Song Zhu unites a group of her best friends and rises up to chase for her own happiness. </p>",

To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

The younger sister Xiuli's second son, Ruoxuan, a high school student with excellent character and grades, loses his young life in a car accident; The older sister Xiufang's only daughter Anxin, a young dance teacher, loses both her legs in the car accident. To help her mother overcome her pain, Xiuli's eldest daughter Ruohua brings Xiuli to her student dormitory. However, Xiuli, who is struggling to heal emotionally, still causes huge trouble to Ruohua, a senior who is about to graduate. Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

                "summary": "<p><b>AMA Supercross</b> is a motorcycle racing sport involving off-road motorcycles on an artificially-made dirt track consisting of steep jumps and obstacles. Professional supercross contest races are held almost exclusively within professional baseball and football stadiums, although one contest is held at a major motorsport venue (Daytona International Speedway) in the island that separates pit lane from the circuit. Supercross is a very technical sport. Supercross was derived of Motocross. While Motocross and Supercross are similar in many respects, there are significant differences as well. For example, the Supercross races are heavily advertised and televised motorsports events held within major cities.</p><p>The sport Supercross is tailored to the TV spectator, as result of widespread television coverage, as its target market. The term \"Supercross\" was coined as the event name for the first organized motocross race that was successfully held inside a stadium in the United States. In 1972, racing promoter Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, president of the AMA at the time, staged what they called the \"Super Bowl of Motocross\" inside the Los Angeles Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. This event was won by Marty Tripes at the age of 16. That initial contest featured many of the top Motocross riders of the time. It was such a commercial success that it spawned many imitators, and the term \"Supercross\" was coined to identify the similar to Motocross stadium cycling events. Modern Supercross races are sanctioned and governed by motorcycle associations, the main series being either the American Motorcyclist Association which is the oldest and most prestigious cycle racing organization (in America), or the Monster Energy series of Supercross Championship events that are in part the work of Clear Channel, who in 2004 contributed expertise in filming on-track gate event competition for Supercross.</p>",

Especially in her romantic relationship with Zhou Kaize, Ruohua is tortured due to excessive pressure from her mother; Facing her disheartened daughter Anxin and her increasingly fragile and evasive son-in-law Qin Feng, Xiufang, who has always been obese, is determined to inspire confidence in her daughter by achieving an unprecedented weight-loss success. Ruohua is once paranoid about her relationship with her mother, but they eventually get back on the right track and untie the emotional knot between mother and daughter; Xiufang ultimately succeeds in losing weight and accompanies Anxin as she walks out of her marriage and stand up again to face her life.</p>",

Based in the United States, the UFC produces events worldwide. The organization showcases nine weight divisions and abides by the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. The UFC has held over 300 events to date. Dana White serves as the president of the UFC while brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta control the UFC's parent company, Zuffa, LLC. The first UFC event was held on November 12, 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the early UFC competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a real fight between competitors of different fighting disciplines, including boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Sambo, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, judo, and other styles. In subsequent competitions, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create an entirely separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.</p>",
