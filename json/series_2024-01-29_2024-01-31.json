She falls in love at first sight with Immortal Lord Mo Chenyuan and forces him back to the demon realm to marry her. Mo Chenyuan has always had a crush on Feng Ruoyao.

The two seem to be quarrelsome foes, but in fact, their love is two-way. No matter what obstacles they encounter, they always treat each other with sincerity. Eventually, they manage to eliminate the gap between the immortal and the demon and get together...</p>",

The President of the Chamber of Fasci Dino Grandi immediately works with the Duce to have Niccolai freed, who had saved his life on the Carso and who is recognized as a war hero. The captain is released at the behest of Mussolini and, upon returning home, tells Grandi that he was arrested because they wanted to know from him the names of those who were dissatisfied with the Duce in the army. One evening Furio Niccolai, while returning home, was attacked by OVRA agents and thrown into the stairwell, dying instantly. Grandi is worried about the situation and King Vittorio Emanuele III di Savoy suggests him to reunite the Grand Council of Fascism. Grandi takes courage and talks about it with the former President of the Senate Luigi Federzoni, not knowing that he is being monitored by Ruggeri.</p>",

The President of the Chamber therefore wants to speed up and tries in vain to also involve Carlo Scorza, the secretary of the Fascist Party. Princess Maria José of Belgium also takes personal initiative and meets Monsignor Montini to look for a way out and to carve out a leading role for her husband Umberto II of Savoy in the peace operation. The Duce, furious at the landing, orders that all the hierarchs hold rallies in their cities to reawaken national pride but Grandi refuses. Mussolini summons all the hierarchs to Palazzo Venezia, discovering that they agree in asking for the convocation of the Grand Council of Fascism, and orders Ruggeri to arrest Grandi.</p>",

Umberto II discovers that his wife is carrying out peace negotiations on her behalf and scolds her harshly. The Prince, with the Anglo-Americans advancing, then tries to convince his father to oust Mussolini but the King says his hands are tied fearing that the Duce has convened the Grand Council to change the dynastic line of the Savoy. Italo Niccolai, Furio's son, is seen in the company of Beatrice Grandi, Dino's niece. The hierarch forbids his niece from seeing the boy because she has joined the anti-fascists but the young woman is too in love with her and the two continue to see each other in secret. Grandi is approached by Ingrid Eriksson, a Swedish journalist sent by Winston Churchill to test the waters for his possible position as prime minister in Mussolini's place. Grandi and Ciano then make an agreement: for the post-Mussolini period they will act as prime minister and party secretary. Marcello Petacci finds out about it from a man from Ciano and her sister, now unable to notify the Duce directly, sends the news to Edda through Colonel Eugen Dollmann; shortly afterwards Mussolini's daughter notices her husband talking to Grandi but he downplays the matter. Grandi approaches Italo, telling him not to associate with his niece anymore but the boy does not seem to fear him and also challenges him on a political level. Clara Petacci, after being harshly scolded by her mother for having lost Mussolini, attempts to commit suicide.</p>",

Galeazzo reassures his wife by saying that she will not betray her father and that he is playing a double game to deliver the traitors to the Duce so as to make a good impression on him. Vittorio Ambrosio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, reports to the King the harsh discussion that took place between Hitler and Mussolini in Feltre and proposes to stop the Duce but Savoy is not at all convinced and asks Pietro Badoglio for advice who tells him that Mussolini's successor must be one of his most loyal followers. The King receives the Duce and tells him that he will continue to support him. Ciano meets Mario Josè and suggests her not to attempt any risky moves. On the eve of the Grand Council, Grandi is received by Mussolini and advises him to pass the buck but the Duce becomes furious and shouts at him that defeatists like him will be punished. Maria José is intercepted while she is talking on the phone with the ambassador to Portugal, Umberto Capodilista, and the King is made aware of it. Grandi decides to send her niece to Cremona to distance her from Italo but despite this the two promise each other eternal love.<br /><br />July 24th. It is the day of the Great Council. Mussolini claims he must resist the attacks. Grandi presents to the participants an agenda for the return of military power to the King. The debate goes on for hours and during a break Mussolini proposes to Grandi to become Foreign Minister in the next government and his future successor but he refuses. In the meantime his wife has been locked in a room by Ruggeri.</p>",

Petacci shows up at Palazzo Venezia while the meeting is in progress and she leaves him a written message. Party secretary Scorza presents another agenda but Grandi opposes it and gets his to be put to the vote: surprisingly, with 19 votes in favor (including that of Ciano), 8 against and 1 abstention, the motion of the President of the party passes Room. After the defeat, Mussolini prepares revenge against the traitors and meets Claretta again. Approached by an emissary of the King, Grandi denies wanting any role in a future government but opposes the possibility that Badoglio could be the Duce's successor. Once he returns home, Grandi discovers that his wife never left and that she has disappeared.<br /><br />July 25th. Mussolini downplays the incident and proposes to arrest all the conspirators who, according to him, undermined the stability of the homeland. The Duce reveals that the Council could change the dynastic line and that many hierarchs would not look kindly on Prince Umberto. The King makes him understand that he has lost on every front and that they will discuss a new government together. At the end of the meeting, however, Mussolini was picked up by the Carabinieri with an excuse and then arrested. Grandi shows up at the OVRA and warns Ruggeri against touching the wife of the future Prime Minister; Antonietta is then freed. Shortly afterwards the King chooses Badoglio as the new Prime Minister, the fascist headquarters are stormed and the Petacci family and the Grandi manage to escape just in time while Beatrice, having returned to Rome after a change of heart, is reunited with Italo.</p>",

The Avenue of Heaven and Earth is like luck, where the able live. The road to the great road is the road to struggle for the road, which has caused the struggle of all races and souls. An era can only support a few people to gain the Tao. Those who have attained the Tao think that standing on the top of the world, they can be free in the future. But I found that even Dao. It's also hard to escape bad luck. There is a ruler above them, harvesting one era after another, and the cultivators of the world want to maintain their ambitions. Ten thousand races and all spirits are just nourished by these rulers. These masters harvest the Taoists, harvest the spirituality of each world, and destroy one by one. The Taoists in the past were unwilling to be reaped and resisted constantly, but failed every time. Until… the protagonist Ye Yu appeared, he peeled away one time and one secret. As he unfolded an epic picture scroll, in this magnificent world, he continued to grow, experience love and friendship, cleanse the dusted Taoist heart, and finally confront the master who harvests all races.</p>",

However, she soon discovers that instead of inheriting vast fortunes, she has been left with massive debts. At her wit's end, several individuals meet at the Li residence: the noble young creditor Shangguan Guchuan, the scholar Fan Zhongju who's in the capital to take the imperial exams and looking for accommodation, and the young man Liu Lang who comes to repay his debt of gratitude to Li Tiandi. With her father gone and the debts outstanding, Xie Quanjia, while dealing with the pressing creditor, decides to let these men settle in the mansion and rent empty rooms to a princess from the Western Regions and her servant fleeing from an arranged marriage, along with Guo Dongli, a restaurant manager, to alleviate the debt burden. From then on, while living together, each individual dedicates their energy to carving out their own success in Changle. Amidst the chaotic pursuit of their dreams and handling the constant flow of visitors to the mansion, they lead lives filled with unrest yet are ultimately joyful.</p>",

However, she soon discovers that instead of inheriting vast fortunes, she has been left with massive debts. At her wit's end, several individuals meet at the Li residence: the noble young creditor Shangguan Guchuan, the scholar Fan Zhongju who's in the capital to take the imperial exams and looking for accommodation, and the young man Liu Lang who comes to repay his debt of gratitude to Li Tiandi. With her father gone and the debts outstanding, Xie Quanjia, while dealing with the pressing creditor, decides to let these men settle in the mansion and rent empty rooms to a princess from the Western Regions and her servant fleeing from an arranged marriage, along with Guo Dongli, a restaurant manager, to alleviate the debt burden. From then on, while living together, each individual dedicates their energy to carving out their own success in Changle.

She falls in love at first sight with Immortal Lord Mo Chenyuan and forces him back to the demon realm to marry her. Mo Chenyuan has always had a crush on Feng Ruoyao. Since he has been seriously injured by his half-brother in secret, he turns Feng Ruoyao's trick to his own use and allows himself to be captured by her in order to recuperate in the demon realm. The two seem to be quarrelsome foes, but in fact, their love is two-way. No matter what obstacles they encounter, they always treat each other with sincerity. Eventually, they manage to eliminate the gap between the immortal and the demon and get together...</p>",

Due to their disagreement with Qionghua Sect's cultivation philosophy, the disciples of Qionghua Sect Yun Tianqing (played by Baron Chen) and Su Yu left Qionghua and went to Qingluan Peak, where they gave birth to their son Yun Tianhe (played by Chen Zheyuan). Not long after, Su Yu passed away. The young Yun Tianhe is not aware of his parents' past, and his father Yun Tianqing also passes away due to illness, leaving him to grow up alone on the mountain. Yun Tianhe runs into Han Lingsha (played by Ju Jingyi), a young lady who breaks into his parents' tomb, and they go down the mountain together to search for his parents' past. In the midst of their journey, they get acquainted with another lady Liu Mengli (played by Mao Xiaohui). In order to understand his father's past, Yun Tianhe, along with Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli, become disciples of the Kunxu Qionghua Sect. Qionghua Sect assigns Murong Ziying (played by Mao Zijun), who is similar in age, to mentor them, and the four become companions. As his background is gradually revealed, the four of them, who have originally sympathized with each other, are plunged into deep pain and confusion. In the end, Yun Tianhe joins hands with his close friends and embarks on the path of saving the world by resisting his fate.</p>",

At her wit's end, several individuals meet at the Li residence: the noble young creditor Shangguan Guchuan, the scholar Fan Zhongju who's in the capital to take the imperial exams and looking for accommodation, and the young man Liu Lang who comes to repay his debt of gratitude to Li Tiandi. With her father gone and the debts outstanding, Xie Quanjia, while dealing with the pressing creditor, decides to let these men settle in the mansion and rent empty rooms to a princess from the Western Regions and her servant fleeing from an arranged marriage, along with Guo Dongli, a restaurant manager, to alleviate the debt burden.

But he's nowhere to be found. Soon, the FBI turns to a rookie agent and a confidential informant in hopes they can ply a convicted clinic bomber and his wife for the intel that will bring this top 10 fugitive to justice.

They also discuss NATO member fears about Russia, Trump floating major tariffs on China, a Kenyan court blocking the deployment of police to Haiti, and French farmers laying siege to Paris. Then, Tommy speaks with Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group, about Iranian proxy groups, why Iran funds them, and the US conventional wisdom that Iran can only be deterred through military action.</p>",

It was a crash course that taught him two things: anyone can understand these issues, and we all have an obligation to try. That's why he started Pod Save the World—a weekly podcast that breaks down international news and foreign policy developments, but doesn't feel like homework. Each week, he and former deputy national security advisor and co-host Ben Rhodes walk you through the latest developments with a variety of experts and take you behind the scenes of big decisions with the people who were there. Count on hearing stories from the White House Situation Room, funny anecdotes, and maybe a few F bombs along the way.</p>",

Amai (Zhang Tianai), the daughter of the Duke of Jingguo in Southern Xia, witnesses her entire family being killed by her childhood friend Chen Qi. Years later, Amai, now a young girl, disguises herself as a man and roams the martial world, seeking revenge against Chen Qi. Through a series of coincidences, Amai saves Shang Yizhi (Zhang Haowei), the son of the Grand Princess, and subsequently helps him escape from dangerous situations multiple times, intertwining their destinies. As war breaks out, Amai sheds her feminine attire and joins the military, becoming an infantry soldier. With her exceptional military talents, she achieves remarkable feats and rises to the rank of General Mai. Alongside this, she assists Shang Yizhi, who is hunted and faces difficulties, in finding his true self and accomplishing great deeds. On the battlefield, Amai repeatedly clashes with General Chang Yuqing (Wang Ruichang) from the enemy forces. Despite their confrontations, they unintentionally go through life-and-death situations together, developing a mutual understanding and respect. However, faced with the brutality of war, Amai willingly sets aside personal attachments and uses her youth and fervor to defend her army. Eventually, after the war's victory, Amai leaves the military, returns to her female identity, retreats from the world, and ultimately finds her own happiness.</p>",

                "summary": "<p>The story follows Amai, a female general of the founding era of the Southern Xia dynasty, who discards her feminine attire and dons battle armor, enduring hardships to become a legendary female warrior. Amai (Zhang Tianai), the daughter of the Duke of Jingguo in Southern Xia, witnesses her entire family being killed by her childhood friend Chen Qi. Years later, Amai, now a young girl, disguises herself as a man and roams the martial world, seeking revenge against Chen Qi. Through a series of coincidences, Amai saves Shang Yizhi (Zhang Haowei), the son of the Grand Princess, and subsequently helps him escape from dangerous situations multiple times, intertwining their destinies. As war breaks out, Amai sheds her feminine attire and joins the military, becoming an infantry soldier. With her exceptional military talents, she achieves remarkable feats and rises to the rank of General Mai. Alongside this, she assists Shang Yizhi, who is hunted and faces difficulties, in finding his true self and accomplishing great deeds. On the battlefield, Amai repeatedly clashes with General Chang Yuqing (Wang Ruichang) from the enemy forces. Despite their confrontations, they unintentionally go through life-and-death situations together, developing a mutual understanding and respect. However, faced with the brutality of war, Amai willingly sets aside personal attachments and uses her youth and fervor to defend her army. Eventually, after the war's victory, Amai leaves the military, returns to her female identity, retreats from the world, and ultimately finds her own happiness.</p>",

                "summary": "<p>The story follows Amai, a female general of the founding era of the Southern Xia dynasty, who discards her feminine attire and dons battle armor, enduring hardships to become a legendary female warrior. Amai (Zhang Tianai), the daughter of the Duke of Jingguo in Southern Xia, witnesses her entire family being killed by her childhood friend Chen Qi. Years later, Amai, now a young girl, disguises herself as a man and roams the martial world, seeking revenge against Chen Qi. Through a series of coincidences, Amai saves Shang Yizhi (Zhang Haowei), the son of the Grand Princess, and subsequently helps him escape from dangerous situations multiple times, intertwining their destinies. As war breaks out, Amai sheds her feminine attire and joins the military, becoming an infantry soldier. With her exceptional military talents, she achieves remarkable feats and rises to the rank of General Mai. Alongside this, she assists Shang Yizhi, who is hunted and faces difficulties, in finding his true self and accomplishing great deeds. On the battlefield, Amai repeatedly clashes with General Chang Yuqing (Wang Ruichang) from the enemy forces. Despite their confrontations, they unintentionally go through life-and-death situations together, developing a mutual understanding and respect. However, faced with the brutality of war, Amai willingly sets aside personal attachments and uses her youth and fervor to defend her army. Eventually, after the war's victory, Amai leaves the military, returns to her female identity, retreats from the world, and ultimately finds her own happiness.</p>",
